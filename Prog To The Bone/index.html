            History of Prog
        </h2> 
        <p>
        Progressive came forth as a movement defined to expand stylistic boundaries within genres, the very 
        word Progressive or short for prog, defines the music as a progress forward into the future
         from what was there before, Because of the very experimental nature of the genre you will see 
         influences from a lot of diffrent places that aren't as commonly explored as more popular ones.
        </p>
         <p>
            Now for a long time until the 1960s progressive music was every type of music, but there came a 
         time where corporations,looking for pop hits severely limited the style of music that artist would 
         perform and sale to a larger audience, from here on out is where more progressive musicians
         decided that the most important part to their music is the personal agency they get by playing it.
